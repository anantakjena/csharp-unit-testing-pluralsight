# .Introduction to .NET Testing with NUnit 3

Releasing bug-ridden code to production is a sure fire way of creating unhappy end-users, management, and development teams. Nobody likes to receive a phone call in the middle of the night saying that the production system has gone down and needs fixing, immediately. In this course, [Introduction to .NET Testing with NUnit 3](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/nunit-3-dotnet-testing-introduction), users gain the ability to create automated tests for you code. First, users learn how to set up a test project and run tests. Next, users discover the different ways to assert on test results such as numbers, collections, and expected exceptions. Finally, users explore how to customize the test execution lifecycle, create data driven tests, and customize NUnit. On this course end, users have the skills and knowledge of automated testing with NUnit needed to help prevent bugs from making their way into production.
