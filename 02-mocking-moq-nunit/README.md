# Mocking with Moq and NUnit

Writing unit tests is hard when dependencies between classes make it tough to separate what's being tested from the rest of the system. [Moq](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/nunit-moq-mocking/table-of-contents) is a mocking library for .NET that makes it easy to create mock objects and make writing unit tests easier.

Codes can be found on the [application domain folder](https://github.com/davikawasaki/csharp-unit-testing-pluralsight/tree/master/02-mocking-moq-nunit/Loans) and on the [application tests folder](https://github.com/davikawasaki/csharp-unit-testing-pluralsight/tree/master/02-mocking-moq-nunit/Loans.Tests).
